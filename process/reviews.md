# Reviewing process

## Rules

We will modify these rules over time when others appear more useful. 

- When an author finds a task as far developed as they can sensibly do,
  they put it in `stage: alpha` and send it into review.
- A task typically goes through two or three (usually sequential) stages of review:
  - Review by Daniel Müllers for possibly more or better didactical ideas
    for the task.
    Use your own judgment whether or when this is useful.
    Do it at least when you do not find your task very convincing.  
    Tasks come with `stage: alpha` and leave with `alpha` or `draft`.
  - Holistic review by Christian Hofmann.
    Tasks come with `stage: alpha` and leave with `alpha`, `beta`, or `draft`.
  - Review for release by Lutz Prechelt.
    Tasks come with `stage: alpha` or `beta` and should leave with `beta`, or `done`.
  - Review by anybody else for specific topic reasons as needed.
- Authors assign a task to a reviewer by writing a line of the following form
  in the reviewer's section below:  
  `ch/chaptername/taskgroupname/taskname.md (authorname)```
- Reviewers make simple changes themselves and defer complex changes to the author.
  They should leave simple changes to the author as well if they believe the author
  will learn from making them.
- Reviewers may add feedback in the task file 
  (a paragraph or itemized list starting with a TODO_1_someauthor marker; default case)
  or write them in the Discord if they believe everybody should see them.
- Reviewers hand the task back to the author or forward to the next reviewer by moving the assignment line
  to the author's section below.
- Authors hand over the improved task to the next reviewer (or the same one again when appropriate).
