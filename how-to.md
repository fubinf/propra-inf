# How to write tasks for a PropPra

The target audience of this document is ProPra authors, not instructors and not students.


## Difficulty levels

Writing a task works differently for different levels of task difficulty.  
Low-difficulty tasks (levels 1 and 2) have lots of detail and guidance in the task description.  
High-difficulty tasks (level 4) in contrast rely a lot on external documentation and
the students' own thinking.  
Medium-difficulty tasks (level 3) have a mix of both.

There will be a tendency to underestimate how difficult a task is for the students,
so make sure a level-3 task feels a lot more like level-2 than like level-4.


## The role of motivation

Given the huge freedom we give students and the superficial manner in which we
check their solutions, the ProPra's success depends massively on the students'
own motivation to learn.

Therefore,

- each taskgroup (the typical case) or individual task (as needed) must carefully explain 
  why the material will be (or can be) useful for a practicing software engineer;
- we should make every attempt at implementing one of the principles described in this article:
